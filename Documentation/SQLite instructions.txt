NOTE: don't follow these instructions because the Northwind4SQLite.sql file is missing some of the required tables such as Employees. 
I am only keeping this in the repo for reference in case I need to follow similar instructions to this in the future.

Download and unzip folder contents per this website instruction: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/

Download the .sql file: https://github.com/markjprice/cs7dotnetcore2/blob/master/sql-scripts/Northwind4SQLite.sql

Instructions:
1. First, create a new folder e.g., C:\sqlite.
2. Second, extract the content of the file that you downloaded in the previous section to the C:\sqlite folder. You should see three programs in the C:\sqlite folder (3 .exe files, this is the sqlite-tools-win32-x86 zip file on the sqlite download page_.


Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.
Click on the Environment Variables button at the bottom.
In the System variables section, find the variable named Path and click on Edit.
In the Edit environment variable window, click on New and type in the full path of the folder where you have sqlite3.exe, for example C:\sqlite.
Click on OK to save the changes and close all the windows.


Open Powershell, navigate to folder where the .sql file is located, then run command: Get-Content Northwind4SQLite.sql | sqlite3 Northwind.db
