// TODO: README notes that this project is simply for experimenting with EF Core, Mediatr and GraphQL. Therefore no features that I would otherwise normally include such as table result pagination/sorting/filtering, overposting protections, decimal precisions in webpage renders, proper logging and exception handling, etc.
